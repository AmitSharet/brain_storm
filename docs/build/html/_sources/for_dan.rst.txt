1. This page will be deleted later on.

2. I wanted to say I learned a lot from this project and I'm proud of the result of my work, even though it's not perfect yet.

   so thank you.

3. Parts that surprised me in the project : the Sphinx and pytest, I didn't think I would like them as much as I did


4. Part that was more difficult for me : dealing with RabbitMQ
